# The Rust Programming Language

Rust is a compiled language with a strong type system. Compiled rust run at native speed and is nearly as energy efficient as C. 

## Key points
* Focus on performance
* Type safety
* Memory safety
* Concurrency (async or threads)
* Borrow checker (prevents data races and track object lifetime)
* No garbage collector

## So what does it look like?

Here's a minimal Rust "Hello, World" example.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

## Who uses Rust?
Almost all major software technology companies use Rust in some capacity. Recently DARPA announced their new 'TRACTOR' project aiming to convert all legacy C code to Rust they do this because they believe it would eliminate most errors related to corrupted memory.

**Some examples:**
* Mozilla
* Amazon
* Google
* Microsoft
* Discord
* Cloudflare
* And many many more...

## Who maintains the Rust ecosystem?
Rust is maintained and managed by the **Rust Foundation**. It's a non-profit organization registered in the United States.

## Rust is open source
Source code of Rust and associated tools is open source. This means anyone can contribute to further evolve and improve the language [Github](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).
