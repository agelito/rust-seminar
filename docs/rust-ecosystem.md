# Rust Ecosystem
Rust is still a relatively new language. Although the ecosystem has grown tremendously in the recent years many areas is still in early development. To know the status of a specific area there is a family of websites called `arewe___yet?` Usually searching for `Rust are we <keyword> yet` will yield some good results.

## Popularity
Rust is the most "admired" language based on the SO Developer surver for multiple years in a row. [SO Developer Survey 2024](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology/#admired-and-desired). At the time of preparing these materials more than 78 billion crates has been downloaded from [crates.io](https://crates.io).
